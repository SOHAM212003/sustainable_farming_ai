# 🌾 Data-Driven AI for Sustainable Farming
**Gen AI Sprint Hackathon — Powered by Data**

A multi-agent AI system that empowers farmers to make sustainable, profitable, and data-informed decisions by collaborating with weather stations and agricultural experts. Our solution reduces environmental impact, optimizes crop yield, and adapts to market trends using AI and long-term memory with SQLite.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

> Agriculture is vital to human survival, but unsustainable practices lead to soil degradation, water scarcity, and high carbon emissions. The challenge is to build a collaborative AI system involving farmers, weather data, and market intelligence — promoting eco-friendly, profitable farming decisions.

## 🧠 Our Solution: Multi-Agent AI System

We developed an intelligent, modular system that simulates collaboration between:

- 👨‍🌾 **Farmer Agent** – Inputs crop preferences, land data, and budget.
- 🤖 **Advisor Agent** – Uses ML models to predict crop yield and sustainability.
- 📊 **Market Researcher Agent** – Analyzes market data to suggest profitable crops.
- 🌦️ **Weather Station Agent** – Shares weather impact scores and rainfall predictions.

All agents share a common **SQLite memory (`memory.db`)** for persistent collaboration.
